So, I just finished the Novella of Apt Pupil last night, for the first time, and I re-watched the film, which I had seen before. Personally, I am more disappointed in the film than I ever was before. I thought that Brad Renfro (rest his soul) was a good pick for the role of Todd Denbrow at the time, though today I think I would have put someone different in his place. Ian McKellen killed it as Kurt Dussander/Arthur Denker, and would still be a top pick now. The ending is what is REALLY throw. X-Men Apocalypse left a lot to be desired. My anticipation for the film piqued when I had heard that Oscar Isaac was not only playing a live-action En-Sabah-Nur, but one that would NOT be fully CGI. Moreover, it would be Bryan Singer tackling his filmography's most underrated themes ever: racism at its roots. Mind you, Bryan Singer's entire body of work has addressed anti-semitism in a way that only Spielberg has: through the use of both historical dramas and science fiction. I do not exaggerate.
