So far I have not been able to get the Surface Book's native wifi chip into monitor mode, but from some info I found it seems that there is a way to do it. First I'll start with the knowns: The Surface Book (and several other Surface devices) use the Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88W8897 \ AVASTAR\ 802.11ac Wireless chipset. Most people with surface devices on linux seem to be using the mwifiex\_pcie driver on Linux. The mwifiex\_pcie driver does not support monitor. I'm using Fluxion version 3.4 and ran into some trouble. Once going through all of the steps to set up the rogue AP, it gets hung up on "Server Starting Server" and won't detect clients or show and activity. The server should start the service, clients should show up in the list, and the DNS server should show activity when running properly. I'm currently using an Alfa AWUS036NH with the rt2800usb Attached below is my `./script/diagnostics.sh` output: @=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@=@. 
I have a MacBook Pro 2017 with a chipset Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0. Since it seems to appear as compatible in aircrack-ng (https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers) I was wondering if it could work without a wireless network adapter. Hi Guys, I"m seeing a lot of new dual band 802.11 ac Wifi Adapters out there that have this specific chipset in them. (Realtek RTL8812AU) I'm running Ubuntu 17 wired connection as my host and just recently installed Kali in a vm using KVM. My ASUS board doesn't have a wireless card. My Ubuntu Kernal is more up to date than 2.6~3.16. I checked: https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers and most of the other chipsets didn't have any linux compatibilty issues, however RTL881.  Ok so long-story short me and a roommate share our wifi. The problem is my roommate always sits on the couch at an angle where he can see everything I do on my computer. I've talked with him, but eventually he always returns to the same position. I've also tried moving but then my roommate moves to a position where he can continue spying on me. So I tested a deauthentication attack (https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=deauthentication) which to my surprise, despite all the disclaimers. Hi all, I'm testing some stuff here at home as a noob and I'm trying to use aircrack-ng to snag my WPA2 wifi key. Unfortunately I never seem to be able to grab the handshake it's looking for for me to crack. There are other devices on the network, but even when I send a deauth (though I only use 5 packets) it doesn't seem to do anything. What am I doing wrong? I've tried following the official documentation here ( but their "examples" # Tools https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools pwntools - write pwn scripts https://github.com/binjitsu/binjitsu/ binjitsu - fork of pwntools https://github.com/zardus/preeny preeny - some helpful preload libraries for pwning stuff https://github.com/mikeryan/crackle crackle - bluetooth cracker american fuzzy lop - fuzzer passive os fingerprinter - scans network traffic to determine. 'lo. So I understand why keeping your router locked down, keeping out the neighbours or people driving by is a good thing in a selfish sense; the more internet for me, the better. But what are the worst things a person could do to you just by being connected to the same wireless network as you? Is getting a careless WEP key cracked by something like this ( really that bad? Forgive my ignorance. Hi guys. Thought I'd contribute a small tutorial here. This is a tutorial for cracking WEP enabled WiFi security with your phone. This tutorial only applies (currently) to the Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Google Nexus 1. You will need to root these devices and install packages through an SD card. So here we go. 1. Install Busy Box (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busyboxampfeature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsInN0ZXJpY3Nvbi5idXN5Ym94Il0.) and Terminal Emulator (http. So I was trying to practice with aircrack-ng at my house, by trying to crack my networks password, and was going along smoothly. That is, until I had to use airodump to actually monitor the network. I typed in the following command airodump-ng -c 33 --bssid 48:F8:B3:E3:46:3C -w /root/Desktop/ wlan0mon and it didn't register anything beyond the "airodump-ng" part, because it acted as if I had only typed in that, bringing up the welcome screen so to speak. Airodump-ng 1.2 rc4 - (C) 2006-2015. 
I was reading the aircrack-ng compatible cards page ( here ( and I only found "old" products. I'd like to buy a USB Wireless AC Dual Band for wifi pentest and packet injection for study purposes. I liked this one, Archer T2U (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LCACS0C/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8ampcolid=P65GXP3S7YCUampcoliid=I1DRAAKSL6BQWIamppsc=1). What are your suggestions for a current (available March 2015) USB Wifi adapter that works out of the box? I have seen mention of the Edimax EW-7811Un nano adapter. It looks good, but I would rather a full size adapter. My assumption is a bigger internal antenna will result in longer distances and better reception. I have looked at the following sources and am feeling overwhelmed. The problem being, manufacturers tend to have several revisions of the same model all with different chipsets. Hey all, So I am trying to set up my wifi dongle into Monitor mode but I'm having some issues, hopefully you can help. On start I login then proceed with the following code: sudo ifconfig wlan0 down sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode Monitor I get this error: "Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06) : SET failed on device wlan0 ; Device or resource busy. How is this possible if I configure the port to be down? Edit: I found a solution. I installed airmon-ng (aircrack), libssl-dev TL;DR: Recompile ath9k and get better signal strength and working injection in Ubuntu. It turns out wireless injection doesn't work correctly when you install Ubuntu with Jay Lee's ( script on a CR48. You end up getting a channel -1 error which is usually fixed by recompiling the driver; the lack of kernel headers for the CR48 kernel stops that. I did this all as root so you're probably going to have to "sudo. Country of purchase: United States Budget range: less than 0 Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): programming/security work Screen size preference: I'm looking for a fairly large 15" + screen with a good resolution(hopefully larger than 1366 by 768) OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): I'll most likely be running Debian or Arch with Gnome. Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): none Performance requir. DVD Link: SMFE: Enjoy. I've installed a few programs in Debian-based Linux distributions, but this one is giving me way too many problems. The program is aircrack-ng ( Right in the official installation ( instruction for Debian/Ubuntu/Xubuntu, it says to run "sudo apt-get install build-essential" to get some of the build libraries. After getting build-essential, I run the apt-get update command. I'm currently trying to debug this issue: #18946 DHCPOFFER from dnsmasq-dhcp get lost (https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18946) (tl;dr Some clients send an DHCPDISCOVER, but a a DHCPOFFER never leaves the router hardware, although being logged. Most other clients usually get an IP address within moments). I'm not here do discuss the router configuration, I'm asking for help to reproduce this problem. I currently have a Debian Jessie machine available, connected to an TP-Link TL-WN722N. 
Recently I did a few researches on the WEP (Wired Equivalency Privacy) and noticed there is alot of flaws to this and alot of programs that anyone can download online and use to crack the encryption keys. I was wondering how do these programs work? Like what are the steps this programs follows? Edit: Let's say i'm using to crack the WEP encryption. I've also been trying to install it via command line and am failing horribly. I've tried sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng numerous times and even tried to compile it and install it from- I've tried all the steps mentioned in the tutorial's on both the ubuntu forum and aircrack-ng's how to/tutorial section of the website. I've googled around a bit on other miscellaneous forums to no avail. Any help would be much appreciated. edit: delet.
