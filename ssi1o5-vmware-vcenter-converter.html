                            <p>Описание. Гипервизор VMware ESXi – самый популярный, функциональный и уникальный в своем сегменте программный продукт для серверной виртуализации. Год в действии: кого и за что наказали по GDPR. Это гостевой пост компании ИТ-ГРАД, предоставляющей виртуальные машины VMware в аренду из облака. В отличии от процедуры расширения диска виртуальной машины VMWare, которую можно выполнить прямо «на-лету», процедура уменьшения размера vmdk файла на гипервизоре VMWare ESXi задача более сложная Технология vdi. Каждый сотрудник, приходя на работу, должен получить доступ к своим программам. Do some of you guys still have the installation. 
При создании виртуальной машины VMware зачастую сложно точно рассчитать какой размер диска ей понадобится в ближайшем будущем, кроме того with support for Windows 10 and Hyper-V v3 VMs! Release Notes: https://pubs.vmware.com/Release_Notes/en/converter/61/conv_sa_61_rel_notes.html Download: https://my.vmware.com/en/group/vmware/evalcenter?p=converter. Для правообладателей. Я уважаю интеллектуальную собственность и готов урегулировать все. Trying to do a p2v capture of an existing computer but vcenter converter is failing with this error message in the job list "An error occured while opening a virtual disk. Verify that the Converter server and the running source machines have a network access to the source and destination ESX/ESXi hosts." I can RDP from the machine that is running vcenter to the computer I want to clone just fine and I can log onto a virtual server running on my ESXi host and rdp to the same physical 
 В данной статье приведён список номеров портов, используемых протоколами tcp/ip транспортного уровня для установки соединения между двумя хостами. 1. The Guest OS works perfectly in Workstation Pro 12. 2. I used vCenter Converter Standalone to copy the VMX to a ESXi 6.0 host. Used all default settings for this migration. 2. After powering on the ESXi VM, I found the Guest OS does not have network access even though it gets an IP address from DHCP, and the router knows about the Guest because it has the MAC address and the IP in the router logs. 3. By default, the Guest OS network adapter is VMXNET3. I also tried setting it to E1000 virtu. Has anyone figured out yet how to run this a domain user / remotely? Run as admin does not work Run as local admin does not work Run as the Administrator account, doesn't work OS Win 2012 R2-2016. The current workaround is to install it on the VM and run it from the VM. Been years still not fixed. Is this going to another late night procmon session until I find all the impersonation rights this sh-t tries to use? Any help would be appreciated, I have a few VMs that I cannot do in online. I have a VM that was created long before I was employed by my company. Whoever created it made it too small. Point being, I need to increase the hard drive size. I found out that vmware vCenter Converter Standalone Client could do the job and I have used it on several other vms. However, I am trying to do the same task (increasing the main hard drive size) on this Windows Server 2003 vm and it just isn't turning out correct. First of all, this is the tutorial I used to increase Hi I have here a problem and I hope someone can help me with this. I downloaded the Nagios XI VMware Appliance from Also I installed the VMware vCenter Converter Standalone to convert the Appliance from Workstation to ESX. Everytime I try to convert it fails at 31-33%, it does not tell why. I tryed to convert it from the vCenter, from local machine, also to a standalone ESX and a ESX which is in the inventory I'm am trying to convert my virtual servers from citrix xenservers to vmware. I'm using the vmware standalone converter. I keep getting the error that it is unable to connect to host. The host is up and running fine. I am unable to find a solution for this. I've looked through the VMware knowledge base and have not turned up anything. I want to see a conversion through from start to finish, but we don't yet have vSphere, and unfortunately my computer access at work is fairly locked down, so I am unable to answer this question on my own here. What I would like to do is convert a physical machine to a VM, but I don't want to send it right away to an existing vSphere installation, because one does not exist yet. However, for testing the procedure, and creating the image, I am wondering if the other option, i.e. creating Hi I have here one old xenserver (main server) (5.6) and i need to move these VM's to temporary server where is ESXi, format and install ESXi to main server and move VM's back from temporary server. 5 Win and 5 Debian VM's. These VM's are very important in office everyday (actually 24/7, because mail), as little downtime as possible is needed. 3.6tb data on all VM's. for testing purposes i tried with VMware Vcenter Converter standalone. Windows seems to be working correctly after conversion. 
Not sure what account was used for SSO. (is this a killer, or can it be reset on the domain and in SSO on 5.1 beforehand?) No Web Management is allowed to be installed. All services are using the local service account, but there is a vmware virtualcentermanagement webservices using the domain$account vSphere profile-driven storage service is using local service. (I see a note in a KB on needing a domain account to connect to external sql2k8r2.) No documentation has been found. Disclaimer - we're very familiar with Microsoft's Hypervisor, but also very new to VMWare. We're running into roadblocks that I'm having a problem finding a simple solution for. Here's the scenario: We have a single physical server running Windows Server 2008r2. It's a Dell Poweredge R420 (supported by ESXi 6.5.) We want to convert the server to a VM that we can then import into ESXi. We have the standalone vCenter converter, but the only options we have are to convert it to a VMWare Workstatio. I need to move it to another site and it's far faster to Convert to file and carry So it was just released today. Has anyone had a chance to install? I have downloaded and will update when I get it installed after. Sorry if this is more of a vmware quesiton. But I am trying to set up diet-pi on esxi 6.5 (with no vcenter) and the vmdk that they provide is for vmplayer. Every single thing ive googled comes back with how to convert it using vCenter which I do not want to install. Is there any way to use this vmdk in esxi? Thanks. I have ESXi 5.1 hosts and vCenter 5 and I want to upgrade to 6. I need to change the real (eww) server where vCenter resides. Trouble is, it's low on storage space making an in-place upgrade to vCenter 6 a pain. A pain but not impossible. I might/could image the VCenter server's disk and move it to a bigger disk. What's the best method here? Is it easier/less trouble to upgrade to 6 first and then move vCenter or put vCenter 5 on the new server and move it and then upgrade it? I wish there. 
Hi folks, One of our branch sites is having workstation issues and word has come down the pipe that they want to take an image of the workstation and run it on our vSphere (v5.1 for reference) to do some additional testing. This thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/36mraa/how_to_p2v_for_vsphere/) suggests using the Converter and that looks perfect, however, the only destinations appear to be sending it to a Hyper-V, ESXi host etc. This site does not have network access to the virtu. Hello All, I am the technology director/coordinator for a small school district, of which I am the entire IT dept. I am a jack of all trades out of necessity, but I do try to focus on my sysadmin/network admin roles as much as possible. With that said, here is my issue: I have a file server VM that is currently home to all of my end users files (through redirected folders). The VM is running on a free copy of VMWare ESXi 4. I have a new UCS chassis running fully licensed Vcenter I'd like to take my Windows 7 Pro machine and reformat/reinstall Windows 7 so that it runs inside a VM. Can I DO that or will Windows interpret the move as an attempt to use my existing license on a different machine? 90% of the time, IT will be the only thing running on my PC, but for that other 10%, I'd like the freedom to try reckless/risky things.and still have the ability to abandon ship and still have a pristine Win7 environment to return to. I'm completely new to VMWare Any issues with creating one CentOS 7 image as a VM on an ESXI host, configuring it, then exporting it as an OVF to create/import multiple VMs? Basically like shitty provisioning I've done it before so all my configs/dotfiles/SSH keys could be on all machines, but not sure of any issues that could arise because
